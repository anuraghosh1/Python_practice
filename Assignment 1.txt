A1)Python as General purpose Lang : As Python can be used for variety of purposes like Web application , data analysis etc.
Python as HLL : As this is version of language which can't be understood directly by the computer but is understood by prgrammers to give instructions to the Hardware.
Usually an interpretor or compiler is required to convert HLL to Low level lang i.e. in bits (0 & 1) . 


A2)Python as dynamically typed language : As the variables are assigned a type at runtime rather than the programmers defining the type beforhand as in 
case of C, C++, Java 

A3)Pros : 
a)Dynamically typed language 
b)Supports a wide range of libraries like NumPy , Pandas, Matplotlib etc. which aid in data science , ML etc. 
c)Easy to learn as we don't have to declare any type & is liberal with the syntax 
d)Good Community support as being used by many developers
e)Portable : As the code once written can run on any number of different platform 

Cons: 
a)Slower that other compiled languages  
b)Multithreading feature not great beacuse of Global Interpretor Lock 
c)Consumes a lot of space as dynamic lang
d)Can have runtime errors as its a dynamically induced language following which the data type is automatically assigned which might not always be the case. 


A4)Domains : 
Data Analysis 
Task Automation 
Web Development 
Scalable Applications 
Machine Learning 
IOT (as it can be embedded plus also usuage with Rasbary Pi etc.)

A5)Variables : Name given to the memory allocation which will hold the data . 
How to declare : variable_name = "XYZ"

A6)Using Input function 
eg. variable_name = input("Input the variable value here")

A7)String 

A8)Type casting is converting the data type from type to another for our programming requirements. 

A9)We can't take more than one input using Input() in python. We have to use Split() for the multiple inputs. 

A10)Keywords: Predefines & resrved words in Python which can't be used as identfiers, function name etc. Eg. ELIF ,AND , OR etc. 

A11) Keywords can't be used as variable name as it is already predefined & may cause runtime error while executing the code as interpretor would find it difficult to predict the funtionality . 

A12)Indentation is the fixed spacing used to mark the beginning of new block of code. 

A13)print("This is the output")

A14)Operators in Python : 
Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators

A15)/ -> Float division 
// --> Integer Division 

A16)
var_name = 'iNeuron'
print("```")
print(var_name * 4)
print("```")

A17)
num_var = int(input('Enter the number'))

if(num_var%2 == 0):
    print('The number is even')

else : 
    print('The number is odd')
	
	
A18)Boolean operator : denotes TRUE or FALSE values 

A19)
1 or 0 -- 1

0 and 0 --> 0

True and False and True --> False

1 or 0 or 0 --> 1 

A20)Conditional statements : 
It executes one block of code if the condition is true else other. Eg: if statement. if-else statement. if-elif-else ladder.

A21)What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
All three are used to denote conditional statements in Python.

A22)Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

age = int(input('Enter the age :'))

if(age > 18 ) :
    print('I can vote')
else:
    print("I can't vote")
	
A23)
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
 
for i in range(len(numbers)): 
    if(numbers[i]%2 == 0):
        print(numbers[i] , ": The number is even") 
    else:
        print(numbers[i] ,": The number is odd") 
		
		
A24)Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

var1 = int(input('Enter the first number : '))
var2 = int(input('Enter the second number : '))
var3 = int(input('Enter the third number : '))

if((var1 > var2) and (var1 > var3)):
    print('The greatest number is : ' , var1)
elif((var2>var1) and (var2>var3)):
    print('The greatest number is : ' , var2)
else : 
    print(('The greatest number is : ', var3))
	
A25)
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

for i in range(len(numbers)): 
    if((numbers[i]%5 == 0)and(numbers[i]<150)):
        print(numbers[i])
    elif(numbers[i]>150):
        i = i + 1 
    elif(numbers[i] > 500):
        break
