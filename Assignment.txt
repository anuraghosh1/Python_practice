Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans.)
Python as General purpose Lang : As Python can be used for variety of purposes like Web application , data analysis etc.
Python as HLL : As this is version of language which can't be understood directly by the computer but is understood by prgrammers to give instructions to the Hardware.
Usually an interpretor or compiler is required to convert HLL to Low level lang i.e. in bits (0 & 1) . 

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans.)
Python as dynamically typed language : As the variables are assigned a type at runtime rather than the programmers defining the type beforhand as in 
case of C, C++, Java 

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans.)
Pros : 
a)Dynamically typed language 
b)Supports a wide range of libraries like NumPy , Pandas, Matplotlib etc. which aid in data science , ML etc. 
c)Easy to learn as we don't have to declare any type & is liberal with the syntax 
d)Good Community support as being used by many developers
e)Portable : As the code once written can run on any number of different platform 

Cons: 
a)Slower that other compiled languages  
b)Multithreading feature not great beacuse of Global Interpretor Lock 
c)Consumes a lot of space as dynamic lang
d)Can have runtime errors as its a dynamically induced language following which the data type is automatically assigned which might not always be the case.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans.)Keywords can't be used as variable name as it is already predefined & may cause runtime error while executing the code as interpretor would find it difficult to predict the funtionality .
